                <p>Increasing prosperity in our
                    lives can be accomplished <br>
                    by having the right frame of mind.
                    The truth is, our<br>
                    thoughts are very powerful.</p>
                <div id="block_id" >
                    They are capable of influencing every aspect
                    of our daily lives, from our physical health
                    to our social behaviors. I’m sure you’ve heard
                    the adage, “As you think, so shall you be.”
                    If we want to improve our lives, we must first improve
                    our thoughts. Harnessing the power of thought in a positive
                    way has the ability to create great change in our lives, including
                    our financial well-being and prosperity. But how? How do we take
                    something as intangible as thoughts, and manifest them into a physical reality?
                    We must first understand that being prosperous is more than
                    having a lot of money. Prosperity is a mindset, a way of
                    interacting in our lives, and a way of thinking. Mastering
                    this train of thought is not easy, but it is simple enough
                    if we keep working on it consistently.
                    Following are some ideas to help you improve your thoughts, and ultimately attract more prosperity into your life:
                    Be grateful for the blessings in your life right now. Take a few minutes each day to express heartfelt gratitude for the good things in your life. Even more powerful, write a few of these blessings down each day. This helps to put your focus in the right direction — on abundance, not lack.
                    Use positive affirmations to begin training yourself to think positively. Use “I am” statements such as “I am worthy of all that is good.” Write the statements down and repeat them nightly before bed. Over time, this will implant these thoughts into your subconscious mind, and you will begin to naturally believe them.
                    Creative visualization can help you achieve prosperity by determining what it is you wish to achieve, and then thoroughly creating that image in your mind. This works in the same way affirmations do. Our subconscious will fill with images of prosperity, and eventually these subconscious “truths” will manifest in the physical. “See” yourself as being prosperous, and you will become so.
                    Encourage yourself with the belief that you can achieve great things. This could also be one of your affirmations, but expand on it. If you know you can earn a certain salary, tell yourself you can earn more. Allow yourself to believe all things are possible, and you will gain the confidence needed to reach higher than you ever imagined you could. If you believe you can do it, you are more likely to take the risks associated with people who are highly successful. Prosperity and success go hand in hand, so take risks and aim higher.
                    Start a savings account. As strange as it sounds, think about this: Like Attracts Like. Even if you can only afford to put a few dollars into your account every month, it will begin to build up and attract more money.
                    Finally, believe you are already wealthy. The creative ability of our thoughts is such that we lend more power and energy to whatever we consistently focus on. Focusing on lack will create more lack. Focusing on wealth and prosperity will create . . . guess what?
                    Remember that this is a process. You likely won’t change your circumstances in one day. But over time, with consistent focus

                <p>Successful businesses have many things in common,<br>
                    today we’ll look at the big ‘R’ of recognition and how a<br>
                    digital advertising network may help.</p>
                <div id="hidden" >
                    Recognition can be illustrated by two individuals entering a crowded
                    room at a party. Both walk to the far side of the room, one of them slips
                    through the crowd easily and unnoticed as they
                    reach the far side. The second person takes much longer to reach
                    the far side because they are engaged in conversations along
                    the way as they continue to meet acquaintances and friends during
                    their path. Which type of person would you like to model your business after?
                    Your business is in a continual battle for your customers’ recognition whether
                    you know it or not. If you happen to be fortunate enough to be in a
                    marketplace with very few competitors, that will not last for long.
                    You need your business to be at the forefront of your client’s minds
                    so that when they require your products or services, you are the go-to people.
                    Marketing your business is a necessity. Putting your name and logo
                    out there and keeping it there is a must. This lets clients know
                    that you are “still around” and in business. Frequency is a good
                    way to achieve the “stand out factor” in recognition. I am reminded of both
                    television and radio ads I had heard of in the past. They run continually with
                    a catch phrase or musical jingle over and over again on the radio or television
                    until you are absolutely sick of hearing it. You also cannot get it out of your head
                    . Although this type of advertising is expensive, it can be very effective, and the
                    recognition factor is quite high. Television and radio can reach a large audience,
                    and they are broad in their appeal. In a brief sentence, you are paying to market to
                    both those that are your potential customers and a large segment of those who are not
                    now and probably never will be your customers.
                    There are more economical ways to pursue frequency, the point is
                    to define your target market demographic, and invest your marketing funds into the locations
                    that will best be seen by them
                    Another factor to consider is “can I market myself in a place where I will stand out from my
                    competition, or where my competition does not have a presence?” Why would you market yourself in a
                    flyer or newspaper right beside your competition and risk blending into a crowd, and ultimately being ignored?
                    Another issue to look at is diversification. As the saying goes, “don’t put all your eggs in one basket”. When
                    you look at your advertising budget for the year, try to find the affordable solutions that will continue to reap
                    during the full year of your advertising budget. An expensive radio or television promotion may give short term gains
                    for that weekend sale, but what about the rest of the year? Your clients may end up with the impression of where did they
                    go, I haven’t seen or heard anything about them for so long.
                    Don’t always look for the old standbys in marketing, but keep your eyes and ears open for the latest and greatest ways to mark
